# MoreThanFood, Combatting Eating Disorders at NYUAD

This frontend was created using ReactJS, using create-react-app.

## How it works

Each month, a new board is available for users to make posts with students anonymously and with mental health professionals. 
Admins can log in with the button on the top right and users are anonymous by default. 
Users can also flag posts they deem inappropriate.
